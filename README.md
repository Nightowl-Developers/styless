# Styless

A React.js component library that is semantically ada compliant but lacks any styles. This is on purpose to keep the components lightweight and easy to build a design system on top of.

## Installation

```shell
// install via yarn
yarn add styless

// install via npm
npm install styless
```

## Documentation
